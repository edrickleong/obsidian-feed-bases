## Obsidian Feed Bases

![](screenshot.png)

Adds a feed layout to [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) so you can display notes with their content in an editable feed view.

- Display all notes from your bases in a scrollable feed.
- Edits are automatically saved back to the source file.
- Sort by modified date, created date, or name (default).
- Click note titles to open them or use context menus for more options.
